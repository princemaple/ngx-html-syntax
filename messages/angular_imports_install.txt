Angular Imports Folding Feature Added
====================================

The Ngx HTML Syntax package now includes Angular imports folding functionality!

Features:
- Optional automatic folding of import statements at the top of .ts files
- Optional automatic folding of imports arrays in @Component/@Directive decorators
- Separate commands for folding import statements vs import arrays
- Opt-in behavior - auto-folding is disabled by default

Settings:
To enable automatic folding, go to Preferences > Package Settings > NgxHTML > Settings
and set "auto_fold_angular_imports": true

Commands:
Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Angular Imports" 
to see all available folding commands.
